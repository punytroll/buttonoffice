- promoted workers provide faster button pushing
- accountants only effect payout if they are working at their desk
- supervisors only makes people faster, not better, maybe even more reckless and unhappy
- toilets, cafeterias and gyms must be cleaned
- toilets, cafeterias and gyms have a capacity and a waiting line
- make elevator cars and elevator shafts breakable
- catch some mice
