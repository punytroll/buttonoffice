After 1.0:
==========
- floating point placement of buildings

- cats can jump (and stay) on desks if no person is sitting there
- better offices do not provide a big payout bonus but will decrease unhappiness per button push, have bigger trash cans, more robust computers, more robust lamps, plus a small payout bonus
- promoted workers provide faster button pushing
- supervisors only makes people faster, not better, maybe even more reckless and unhappy
- toilets, cafeterias and gyms must be cleaned
- toilets, cafeterias and gyms have a capacity and a waiting line
- make elevator cars and elevator shafts breakable
- catch some mice
- broken lamps influence the speed of working
